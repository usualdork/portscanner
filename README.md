# Portscanner
This Python project is a basic port scanner that allows you to scan a target system for open ports. It provides a simple way to check which ports are open on a given IP address or range. The scanner is a command-line tool that uses Python's built-in `socket` library to perform port scans.
Features:
- Scan a target system for open ports.
- Specify a range of ports to scan.
- Fast and lightweight, suitable for basic network reconnaissance.

Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the scanner by executing the Python script.
3. Enter the target IP address and port range to begin scanning.

Note: This project is made only for educational purposes. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before scanning any system or network. Unauthorized scanning can have legal consequences.

Any suggestions for improvement are most welcomed.
Thanks
